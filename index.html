                    <h3>Online Painting Classes</h3>
                    <p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
                        The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. 
                        In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). 
                        But we all know that! 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Now we provide fully online classes to suit everyone across similar timezones.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Figure drawing</h3>
                    <p>A figure drawing is a drawing of the human form in any of its various shapes and postures using any of the drawing media. 
                        The term can also refer to the act of producing such a drawing. The degree of representation may range from highly detailed, 
                        anatomically correct renderings to loose and expressive sketches. A life drawing is a drawing of the human figure, traditionally nude, 
                        from observation of a live model. Creating life drawings, or life studies, in a life class, has been a large element in the traditional 
                        training of artists in the Western world since the Renaissance.

                    <h3>Pottery Classes</h3>
                    <p>Pottery is the ceramic material which makes up potteryware. Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. 
                        The place where such wares are made is also called a pottery (plural "potteries"). Pottery also refers to the art or craft of a potter or the making of pottery.
                        A dictionary definition is simply clay fired in a kiln. Pottery objects are made from damp clay mixed with other materials. 
                        They are then fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures. Firing makes the clay hard. The potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before 
                        firing the object again. The fired glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny, decorative and water-tight.
                        Some potters make objects which are not useful and are really artistic objects or sculpture. Bare pottery objects without a glaze are called bisque or 
                        just earthenware. The finest pottery objects, made of porcelain or bone china are quite strong, yet are translucent. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Dont worry if youre just a beginner, our classes begin at different levels to suit everyone's needs.

                    <h3>Photography Classes</h3>
                    <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, 
                        or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography),
                        and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.
                        <br/> 
                        <br/>
                        In our studio you can find fully supplied a photography studio which includes cameras, lights, backdrops and models available on request.
